# IsoQ - Single analysis for metabolomics and isotopic studies

## What is IsoQ?
**IsoCor is a scientific software dedicated to the automated processing of metabolomics and isotopic MS measurements**.
IsoQ corrects raw MS data (mass fractions) for
naturally-occurring isotopes of all elements and purity of the
isotopic tracer using IsoCor, and calculates metabolite concentrations 
from calibration curves.

It is one of the routine tools that we use at the [MetaSys team](http://www.lisbp.fr/en/research/molecular-physiology-and-metabolism/metasys.html) and [MetaToul platform](http://www.metatoul.fr) in isotopic studies of metabolic systems.

The code is open-source, and available under a GPLv3 license.

## Quick-start
IsoQ requires Python 3.5 or higher and run on all plate-forms.

To install IsoQ locally, download the github repository and run:

```bash
$ pip install -e /path/to/IsoQ/
```

## Bug and feature requests
If you have an idea on how we could improve IsoQ please submit a new *issue*
to [our GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/MetaSys-LISBP/IsoQ/issues).
